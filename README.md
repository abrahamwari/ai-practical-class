# Artificial Intelligence Lab class experiments 
Welcome to my GitHub repository for documenting my semester works in Artificial Intelligence! Throughout the semester, I've worked on several practical class related to AI, including:

Searching algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search.
Problem-solving algorithms like the Water Jug problem and the 8-Puzzle problem.
Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition and classification.
In this repository, you'll find code samples, detailed explanations, and the results of each project. Each project is contained within its own folder, and you can explore each one to see the algorithms in action and the challenges I encountered along the way.

I hope that this repository provides you with an insight into the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence, and that you find my work informative and helpful. Thank you for taking the time to explore my projects!
